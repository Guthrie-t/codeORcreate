            <p>
                The National Digital Inclusion Alliance, or NDIA, identifies Digital Inclusion as including five elements: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>affordable, robust broadband internet service</li>
                <li>internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user</li>
                <li>access to digital literacy training</li>
                <li>quality technical support</li>
                <li>applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                These five elements are critical to positively impacting communities, leading kids to perform better in school, 
                improving the accessibility of care for senior citizens, allowing adults to get and keep better jobs, creating 
                a better and more competitive workforce for local businesses, and cultivating an attractive local environment 
                where everyone in the community knows they are all equipped to thrive, contribute, and succeed.

            <h2 class="mb-4">How does this relate to Lane County</h2>
            <p>
                The City of Eugene Broadband Strategic Plan, finalized in 2013, notes that Eugene and the surrounding Lane County 
                areas are uniquely positioned for innovation and support of strategic initiatives to boost Digital Equity. They 
                identify these three points as key to Equity and Inclusion: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A digital divide, either geographically or along socioeconomic lines, is counter to our communityâ€™s values; 
                    policy and funding decisions in support of closing those gaps is endorsed
                </li>
                <li>
                    we must empower all in the community to participate in the knowledge economy and our regional innovation ecosystem
                </li>
                <li>
                    we need to create awareness about the importance of broadband adoption to education, work, and quality of life 
                    by raising definitional standards of literacy to include digital skills.
                </li>
            </ol>
