        <h3>What else do we know about Digital Equity and Inclusion?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                TOP LEVEL BLURB: There are five elements critical to positively impacting communities, leading kids to
                perform better in school, improving the accessibility of care for senior citizens, allowing adults to
                get and keep better jobs, creating a better and more competitive workforce for local businesses, and
                cultivating an attractive local environment where everyone in the community knows they are all equipped
                to thrive, contribute, and succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                ADD’L ACCORDION INFO: The National Digital Inclusion Alliance, or NDIA, identifies these as Digital
                Inclusion. They include five elements: 1) affordable, robust broadband internet service; 2)
                internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 3) access to digital literacy training; 4)
                quality technical support; and 5) applications and online content designed to enable and encourage
                self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration.

            <h3>How does this relate to Lane County</h3>
            <p>
                TOP LEVEL BLURB: We’re glad you asked! The City of Eugene Broadband Strategic Plan, finalized in 2013,
                notes that Eugene and the surrounding Lane County areas are uniquely positioned for innovation and
                support of strategic initiatives to boost Digital Equity.
            </p>
            <p>
                ADD’L ACCORDION INFO: They identify these three points as key to Equity and Inclusion: 1) A digital
                divide, either geographically or along socioeconomic lines, is counter to our community’s values; policy
                and funding decisions in support of closing those gaps is endorsed; 2) we must empower all in the
                community to participate in the knowledge economy and our regional innovation ecosystem; 3) we need to
                create awareness about the importance of broadband adoption to education, work, and quality of life by
                raising definitional standards of literacy to include digital skills.
