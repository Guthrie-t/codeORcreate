            <h3>What is Digital Equity?</h3>
            <p>
                For a long time, the concept of Digital Equity was addressed under terms such as the digital divide, and
                it primarily focused on whether populations had access to actual technology hardware, specifically
                computers. Today, Digital Equity refers to the ability to access and effectively use the technology
                necessary for participation in modern society. It’s closely related to Digital Inclusion, which is the
                process of implementing Digital Equity, the steps taken to ensure that all individuals and communities
                have the access to technology and the knowledge to effectively use it.<br />

                Currently, there are still broad digital divides between Eugene and the more rural neighbor communities,
                and these disparities obstruct the community from meeting economic challenges. There are even portions
                of the Eugene metro area itself that are chronically underserved. We hope to bridge the gap to one of
                those obstacles here -- service. We’ve gathered together a list of known providers in the Lane County
                area and sorted them by the programs they offer and the unique demographics or life situations they
                serve.

            <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
            <p>
                TOP LEVEL BLURB: Digital Equity is absolutely necessary for an individual’s full participation in
                society, democracy, and economy. We’ve seen this in an increasingly heavy spotlight during the
                COVID-era, where technology not only affects an individual’s ability to participate in work and school,
                but also impacts their ability to safely socialize, access vital health information, and even utilize
                options as simple as participation in curbside delivery.<br />

                ADD’L ACCORDION INFO: It is important to avoid the assumption that Digital Equity is solely an issue
                faced by those in rural communities. While this is certainly true, restricting Digital Equity solutions
                to rural regions can largely ignore underserved urban populations, such as BIPOC and Latinx communities.
                Bringing resources and solutions to ALL communities in need is a fundamental concept of Digital Equity
                as a whole, and leads to a host of economic benefits to both individuals and communities.
