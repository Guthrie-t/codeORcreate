                <p>
                    For a long time, the concept of Digital Equity was addressed under terms such as the digital divide, and
                    it primarily focused on whether populations had access to actual technology hardware, specifically
                    computers. Today, Digital Equity refers to the ability to access and effectively use the technology
                    necessary for participation in modern society. It’s closely related to Digital Inclusion, which is the
                    process of implementing Digital Equity, the steps taken to ensure that all individuals and communities
                    have the access to technology and the knowledge to effectively use it.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    Currently, there are still broad digital divides between Eugene and the more rural neighbor communities,
                    and these disparities obstruct the community from meeting economic challenges. There are even portions
                    of the Eugene metro area itself that are chronically underserved. We hope to bridge the gap to one of
                    those obstacles here -- service. We’ve gathered together a list of known providers in the Lane County
                    area and sorted them by the programs they offer and the unique demographics or life situations they
                    serve.

                <h2 class="mb-4">Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Digital Equity is absolutely necessary for an individual’s full participation in society, democracy, 
                    and economy. We’ve seen this in an increasingly heavy spotlight during the COVID-era, where technology 
                    not only affects an individual’s ability to participate in work and school, but also impacts their 
                    ability to safely socialize, access vital health information, and even utilize options as simple as 
                    participation in curbside delivery. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    It is important to avoid the assumption that Digital Equity is solely an issue faced by those in rural 
                    communities. While this is certainly true, restricting Digital Equity solutions to rural regions can 
                    largely ignore underserved urban populations, such as BIPOC and Latinx communities. Bringing resources 
                    and solutions to ALL communities in need is a fundamental concept of Digital Equity as a whole, and 
                    leads to a host of economic benefits to both individuals and communities.
